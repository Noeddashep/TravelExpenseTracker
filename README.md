# TravelExpenseTracker
TravelExpenseTracker is a Python app developed for educational purposes by a TomorrowDevs student for managing travel expenses.

Track your daily expenses in categories such as meals, transportation and accommodation. You will have the opportunity to correct any errors and it will inform you if you stick to your budget.

# Program Execution
Make sure you install the necessary dependencies that will make the project work properly. Use the following terminal command:
```sh
pip install -r src\requirements.txt
```
The program is executed by the main function, which coordinates the execution of various functions. To run the program, make sure Python is installed on your system application, clone the repository and launch the application using the command:

```sh
python main.py
```
After running the program, you will follow the on-screen instructions to enter your travel information and expenses.
The instructions are simple, you will need to enter the number of days of your trip and your initial budget in numerical form.
They will be recorded by the program, which will allow the user to enter expenses relating to different categories.

If your expenses exceed your initial budget, the program will show you a message and will block, preventing you from entering other expenses.
You can still correct your expenses later. In fact, you will be able to choose whether to delete all expenses or delete the expenses entered in the last day.
If you enter incorrect inputs, the application will allow you to re-enter them until they are entered correctly.
At the end, the program will provide a summary of your travel expenses and budget control.
