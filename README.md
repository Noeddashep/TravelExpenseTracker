# TravelExpenseTracker
TravelExpenseTracker is a Python app developed for educational purposes by a TomorrowDevs student for managing travel expenses.

Track your daily expenses in categories such as meals, transportation and accommodation. You will have the opportunity to correct any errors and it will inform you if you stick to your budget.

# Program Execution
The program is executed by the main function, which coordinates the execution of various functions. To run the program, make sure Python is installed on your system, clone the repository and launch the application by running the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```
Once the program has started, follow the on-screen instructions to enter your travel information and related expenses. The instructions are clear and simple: enter the duration of your trip in days and your initial budget, in numerical form. This data will be recorded by the application, allowing the user to enter expenses relating to different categories.

In case your expenses exceed the initial budget, the program will show you a message and prevent the entry of further expenses. However, you will have the option to correct your expenses later. You can choose to delete all expenses or remove only those entered in the last day.

If you enter incorrect inputs, the application will allow you to re-enter them until they are entered correctly.

At the end of the trip, the program will provide a complete breakdown of the expenses incurred during your trip and the current situation of your budget.
